# BLJ Simulator
This is a very basic tool to practice the timing needed for hitting consistent blj's in sm64. The timing required to hit a blj every time is to jump on frames 1 4 6 or 1 4 8.

This project is based on a video I watched [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bqxc33hzpU), I am using the same audio files used in the video as well.

# Usage
#### The goal of this tool is to help you achieve consistent timing for hitting blj's in sm64.

The program will start when a key is pressed, every "run" of the program will display all frames that have had a key pressed on, you want to get a combination of 1 4 6 or 1 4 8 in order to successfully do a blj.

Each run lasts for 1 second and there are 30 frames but we stop the count after frame 13 because at that point you're through the door.


# Plans for this project:
- ~~Add Xbox controller support~~
- ~~Add mute button~~
- ~~Add toggle between 146 and 148 audio files~~
- Add toggle button between 146 and 148 audio files instead of key toggle
- ~~Host on github or somewhere idk~~ [Link](https://kdiab.github.io/blj-simulator/)
