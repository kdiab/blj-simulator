# BLJ Simulator
This is a very basic tool to practice the timing needed for hitting consistent blj's in super mario 64. The timing required to hit a blj every time is to jump on frames 1 4 6 or 1 4 8.

This project is based on a video I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bqxc33hzpU, I am using the same audio files used in the video as well.
